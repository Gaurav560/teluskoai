In fields of golden grain so bright,
Where morning dew reflects the light,
A gentle breeze begins to dance,
Through nature's sweet and wild expanse.

The mountains stand with peaks so high,
They kiss the clouds that pass them by,
While rivers flow with crystal clear,
Their melodies for all to hear.

In gardens where the flowers bloom,
Their fragrance fills each quiet room,
The bees and butterflies take flight,
From dawn until the fall of night.

Oh peaceful world of wonder vast,
Where moments beautiful will last,
In memory's sweet and tender keep,
Like dreams that visit us in sleep.

The stars above begin to shine,
Like diamonds in a grand design,
And in this tranquil evening hour,
We feel life's most enchanting power.
